# NBA React App Project

##Home

This was my first project while learning the Reactjs framework. It's a mock NBA website that starts with a homepage including highlights, a poll for the user to choose who would be the next champion, and an email subscribe form that does basic email validation.

## Teams Page
The page renders all the teams available in the json database and displays them in a grid view with a search bar at the top. The search bar will filter as the user types, constantly changing the view as the user types in the search box.

## Team Page
